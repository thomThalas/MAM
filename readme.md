* Each image should be named corresponding to what task you have taken a picture of.
* Like for example `TM100.png` or `cbog8.16.jpg`
* If you wish to use 2 images then rename the second image to something you can recognize later that would signify the order of the image but remember to keep the original image name the same as before. This would be something like `TM100_2.png`.
* Now choose A,B or C through the dropdown of the image.
* To preview the final pdf page then press the `👁` button.

* To save the pdf press the `💾` button to save the pdf.

* If you want to save multiple images to one pdf then press the `🔗` button on 2 images.
The first will be the first page while the second will be the second page. If you want to continue to chain more pictures then do the same as before except you start from the second picture.

# Settings

* On the left side there are a couple of settings.
* The first 2 options `image_path` and `output_path` are the path to the folder where all the images are and where to output the pdf files.
* All of the padding options change how much padding the image gets for the page.
* You need to adjust the `top_padding` so it fits for your template.pdf
